## Development

See [tasmota/CHANGELOG.md](tasmota/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed change information.

Unless your Tasmota powered device exhibits a problem or you need to make use of a feature that is not available in the Tasmota version currently installed on your device, leave your device alone - it works so don't make unnecessary changes! If the release version (i.e., the master branch) exhibits unexpected behaviour for your device and configuration, you should upgrade to the latest development version instead to see if your problem is resolved as some bugs in previous releases or development builds may already have been resolved.

The Tasmota development codebase is checked every 1-2 hours for changes. If new commits have been merged and they compile successfuly, new binary files for every variant will be posted at http://thehackbox.org/tasmota/ (this web address can be used for OTA updates too). The last compiled commit number is also indicated on the same page. It is important to note that these binaries are based on the current development codebase. These commits are tested as much as is possible and are typically quite stable. However, it is infeasible to test on the hundreds of different types of devices with all the available configuration options permitted.

Note that there is a chance, as with any upgrade, that the device may not function as expected. You must always account for the possibility that you may need to flash the device via the serial programming interface if the OTA upgrade fails. Even with the master release, you should always attempt to test the device or a similar prototype before upgrading a device which is in production or is hard to reach. And, as always, make a backup of the device configuration before beginning any firmware update.

## Disclaimer

:warning: **DANGER OF ELECTROCUTION** :warning:

If your device connects to mains electricity (AC power) there is danger of electrocution if not installed properly. If you don't know how to install it, please call an electrician (***Beware:*** certain countries prohibit installation without a licensed electrician present). Remember: _**SAFETY FIRST**_. It is not worth the risk to yourself, your family and your home if you don't know exactly what you are doing. Never tinker or try to flash a device using the serial programming interface while it is connected to MAINS ELECTRICITY (AC power).

We don't take any responsibility nor liability for using this software nor for the installation or any tips, advice, videos, etc. given by any member of this site or any related site.

## Note

Please do not ask to add new devices unless it requires additional code for new features. If the device is not listed as a module, try using [Templates](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/Templates) first. If it is not listed in the [Tasmota Device Templates Repository](http://blakadder.github.io/templates) create your own [Template](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/Templates?id=creating-your-template).

## Quick Install
Download one of the released binaries from https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases and flash it to your hardware [using our installation guide](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/installation/).

## Important User Compilation Information
If you want to compile Tasmota yourself keep in mind the following:

- Only Flash Mode **DOUT** is supported. Do not use Flash Mode DIO / QIO / QOUT as it might seem to brick your device.
- Tasmota uses a 1M linker script WITHOUT spiffs **1M (no SPIFFS)** for optimal code space.
- To make compile time changes to Tasmota use the `user_config_override.h` file. It assures keeping your custom settings when you download and compile a new version. You have to make a copy from the provided `user_config_override_sample.h` file and add your setting overrides. To enable the override you have to set a compile define as documented in the `user_config_override_sample.h` file.

## Configuration Information

Please refer to the installation and configuration articles in our [documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs).

## Migration Information

See [wiki migration path](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/Upgrading?id=migration-path) for instructions how to migrate to a major version. Pay attention to the following version breaks due to dynamic settings updates:
